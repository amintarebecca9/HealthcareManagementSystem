# HealthcareManagementSystem
The Healthcare Management System (HMS) is designed to digitize patient data management, enhance doctor-patient interaction, and incorporate AI-driven healthcare recommendations. It includes secure user authentication and role management to regulate access for doctors, patients, and staff. The system features electronic health records (EHR), allowing patients to upload medical history, lab reports, and prescriptions, while doctors can update consultation notes. A secure messaging and notification system facilitates doctor-patient communication and automated reminders for appointments and medications. Additionally, search and filtering functionalities enable quick retrieval of patient history, medications, and diagnoses. To ensure data security and compliance, the system integrates encryption and HIPAA-compliant security protocols, safeguarding sensitive medical information.
